### Here be dragons (or at least AWS Cloud Formation Scripts)
In the hopes that this might be useful to someone, I am including my AWS
Cloud Formation scripts here.  This is *NOT* a required part of the reading,
so feel free to run away ;).

Still here?  Well alright then.

The included `lab1.yml` file is also stored in AWS S3, when you click the
link in the lab `README.md` it auto-populates the S3 link to this template in 
Cloud Formation.  Feel free to inspect thie `lab1.yml` file and make any 
changes/recommendations.  You can also upload this file directly to AWS Cloud
Formation instead of using my crazy link (in case you update `lab1.yml1 and 
want to test it out).

Now go get back to working on the lab!
